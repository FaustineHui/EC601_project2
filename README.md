## Part(a): Twitter API

* Find all tweets from a specific user

In the folder named "all_tweets", I just use the code which the professor showed in class. It helps me to get all tweets from a specific user. I choose "@BlackMyth_GS" as my test subject and I get all tweets and put it into twitter.json.

* Find tweets from a specific keyword
Sometimes, we need to find tweets by keywords. So I just try it and my keyword is "blackmythwukng". There have lots of tweets, so I just let count=10. I put it into tagfind.json.

P.S. For account security, I read my key.txt as input. If you want to test the code, please use your own key.
